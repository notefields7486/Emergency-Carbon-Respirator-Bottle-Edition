# Emergency-Carbon-Respirator-Bottle-Edition

Emergency Carbon Respirator for Protesters: Bottle Edition

v. 0.01

Background:

This design is motivated by Scotty from the Strange Parts YouTube Channel and his call to action to develop an open sourced, 3D printable gas mask for protesters. If you haven't watched his video, please go and check it out here.

This respirator design is intended to contribute to the larger 'open source gasmask project', by exploring a scaled back and easily printable, minimal viable product. Specifically, a carbon filter, emergency half face respirator, held against the face with one hand. This design is made from 3D printed parts and readily available materials.

Critical Safety Notice and Considerations:

No claims are made about the effectiveness or efficacy of this design. Use of this design for any purpose is at the discretion of the user who holds all risk and responsibility. Commercially available and certified respirators and PPE will always be the appropriate option for any personal protection purpose. If this design is used, it should only be for emergency purposes, for as short a period of time as possible, and where no other form of protection is available.

This is an early work in progress. Significant development is needed to refine the design and validate its effectiveness against respiratory agitating agents. 

Intended Function/ Design Intent:

This design is a half face respirator intended to be held against the face with one hand. The face side shape is under development and currently (as of v0.1) may need to be manually pinched around the nose to form an airtight seal depending on face shape. With a little bit of practice this can still be done quickly and consistently with one hand. 

The intended use of this respirator is to be kept readily accessible and applied when respiratory irritants are released into the environment, either to assist in the immediate departure from the area, or to enable action to naturalise the source of irritant. 

As this respirator design only covers the mouth and nose, further protective equipment will be needed for the eyes. This is beyond the scope of this design, it is recommended that you conduct your own research. A pairing of swimming goggles and certified shatter resistant machinery glasses may be appropriate.

While this design is intended to be manually held against the face, an alternative design has been included which provides anchor points on the filter for mounting straps or other hardware. This alternative design has been included to encourage customisation and further experimentation by the community.

Testing:

Limited testing has been conducted on the respirator as of design v0.1. 

Test - Perfume
- Setup: Fully assembled respirator is placed against the face with one hand, with figures pinched around the nose to assist an airtight seal around the face. Perfume is sprayed parallel and close to the filter end. This was repeated for 3 separate people.
- Results: No smell detected by 2 of the users. Very slight smell detected by 1 user.

This limited testing may be indicative of the filters ability to protect from respiratory irritants. Further testing will be required.

Printing and Assembly instructions:

Parts list:

Printed Part A: Filter Cartridge
Printed Part B: Filter Cap
Recommend material - PLA or PETG
Estimated total print time - 8.5 hr
Estimated total material used - 65 g

2L Soda Bottle (or equivalent large bottle), keep the cap

Activated Carbon - Approximately 85g

Tape (Cloth or duct tape preferred, but any type of tape should be workable)

3x M3 screws (can be between 10mm and 18mm in thread length)
3x M3 nuts

Glue ('guerrilla glue' type recommend, but any glue or material able to form an airtight seal can be used)

Equipment:
Scissors
Permanent marker

Print Settings:

Recommend material - PLA or PETG

Nozzle diameter - 0.4mm
Layer height - 0.2mm
Wall line count - 10
Infill - 40%
Shell top layer count - 10 (recommend)

Supports - none

All other settings - typical print settings

Construction and Assembly 
1. Print Part A- Filter Cartridge and Part B - Filter Cap
2. Mark and cut the 2L bottle along a straight horizontal line just above where it begins to tapper at the top (please experiment with different shapes as you wish and share results)
3. Apply tape along the edge of the bottle to assist seal and comfort
4. Screw on the original bottle cap and test fit the bottle against your face to check for an airtight seal. Modify bottle as needed
5. When happy with the fit, apply glue to bottle threading and screw on Part A - Filter. Leave to dry as required
6. Install M3 nuts and bolts on the Filter Cartridge
7. Insert cotton wadding and activated charcoal into the Filter Cartridge and then close with Part B -Filter Cap. Do this by, first adding a thin layer of cotton to the bottom of the cartridge, just enough to prevent activated charcoal from falling though the filter. Then fill the filter with activated charcoal until almost at the M3 bolts. Add another thin layer of cotton to prevent the carbon falling out the front and close with Part B- Filter Cap

What is Bottle Edition?:
The purpose of the label 'Bottle Edition' is to help differentiate this design from future, designs and projects which may wish to use the common name of 'Emergency Respirator for Protesters'.

This respirator design is intended to assist the larger project of developing an open source, 3D printable gas mask for protesters. To this point - on the off chance this design gains traction - I do not want it to overshadow future designs or project branches. If they wish, I encourage future projects to use the common title of 'Emergency Respirator for Protesters', but to assign a new version name to help differentiate design branches.

Feedback and Collaboration:

I am very open to feedback and would greatly appreciate any help to further test and validate the respirator design. I will update the model and this page as suggestions come in.

I may be open to direct collaboration, but I am not sure what that would look like at the moment. If you have any suggestions for collaboration methods please feel free to reach out, I would be happy to discuss.

Fusion 360 .3fl editable file notes:

The threading for this design was created using the 
PCO1881 thread profile created by  terahurts which can be found on their thiniverse page https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2693686. This design uses profile V3.

The anchoring for the filter cartridge can be turned on and off by enabling/ disabling the feature group 'anchor'.

Acknowledgements:

First and foremost, to all the brave people around the world taking to the streets to bring about change. If not me, who? If not now, when?

Thank you to Scotty and the Strange Parts community for putting out the call for this project, I hope this will help towards your larger vision.
